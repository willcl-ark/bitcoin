Notable changes
===============

Updated RPCs
------------

* Script decoding behaviour in various RPCs has been updated.
  Previously, the `asm` representations silently displayed pushed values of 4 bytes or fewer in decimal encoding, while representing values larger than 4 bytes in little endian hexadecimal.
  This inconsistent behaviour, which was not documented, led to confusion when interpreting various values.

  The following changes have been implemented:

    * Drop "OP_" prefix from all opcodes
      * OP_n -> n (so -1, 0, 1, ..., 10, ..., 16)
    * Display pushes < 5 bytes using little endian hex <0x...> format
    * Display pushes > 5 bytes using big endian <...> format
    * For minimal pushes display the value without the related push opcode
    * For non-minimal pushes prefix the value with the push opcode

  These changes will affect the `asm` output of the `getrawtransaction`, `decodetransaction`, `decodescript` and `decodepsbt` RPCs.
  See #7996 and #27795 for more discussion.
