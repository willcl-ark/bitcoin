-------

- Bash completion files have been renamed from `bitcoin*.bash-completion` to
  `bitcoin*.bash`. This means completions can be automatically loaded on demand
  based on invoked commands' names when they are put into the completion
  directory (found with `pkg-config --variable=completionsdir
  bash-completion`) without requiring renaming.
