Tools and Utilities
-------------------

- A new `bitcoin-privbcast` utility announces one final transaction to a small,
  fixed number of peers over Tor without involving a running node. It resolves
  the release DNS seeds through the Tor proxy, connects to a bounded set of
  exit-path and onion peers on a schedule fixed when the job starts, serves the
  transaction once per peer, and prints a JSON report. Given a child and its
  unconfirmed parent it announces the child and serves the parent to a peer that
  asks for it, for one-parent-one-child package relay. It shares no address
  manager, ban list, connection table or caches with `bitcoind`, so nothing a
  recipient observes can be tied to the node. Check the transaction with
  `testmempoolaccept` first and watch for receipt with `getmempoolentry`; see
  `doc/design/private-broadcast-tool.md`. The tool is built when the
  `BUILD_PRIVBCAST` CMake option is enabled, which follows `BUILD_TESTS` by
  default. (TODO: PR number)

P2P and network changes
-----------------------

- `-privatebroadcast` now runs the same bounded, fixed-schedule jobs as
  `bitcoin-privbcast`, inside the node: each transaction submitted with
  `sendrawtransaction` becomes one job that announces it to a few peers found
  through the release DNS seeds (resolved through Tor) and the fixed onion
  seeds, over the node's Tor SOCKS5 proxy, and then stops. The node no longer
  opens `private-broadcast` connections through its connection manager, does
  not pick recipients from its address manager, does not reattempt until the
  transaction is seen back, and no longer uses I2P for private broadcast; a
  Tor SOCKS5 proxy is required. The node no longer waits for a working onion
  connection before sending to IPv4 and IPv6 peers through the proxy: a job
  takes those peers only from answers to Tor's SOCKS RESOLVE extension, so a
  proxy that is not Tor reaches no one. `-connect` is no longer
  incompatible with `-privatebroadcast`. Jobs run at most two at a time, with a
  bounded queue. Private broadcast jobs ignore `-onlynet`: with `-onlynet=onion`
  they still resolve the DNS seeds through Tor and connect to IPv4 and IPv6
  peers through Tor exits. Previously private broadcast connected only to
  reachable networks. Jobs likewise find their recipients through the release
  DNS seeds and fixed seeds regardless of `-dnsseed`, `-fixedseeds`,
  `-connect`, `-seednode` and `-addnode`. (TODO: PR number)

Updated RPCs
------------

- `getprivatebroadcastinfo` now lists private broadcast jobs (`jobs`), each
  with an `id`, `state` (queued, running, done, aborted), timestamps, whether
  the node's own mempool has since seen the transaction, and the finished
  job's full report. `abortprivatebroadcast` takes a job `id` instead of a
  transaction hash. (TODO: PR number)

- `testmempoolaccept` leaves the node's validation caches and its coins cache
  exactly as it found them: the coins fetched for the check are uncached again,
  no signature or script cache entries are stored, and entries already present
  are not marked for eviction. A transaction that was only test-accepted is
  therefore no faster to validate when it is later submitted or received.
  Package test-accepts already behaved this way for the coins cache. Reading the
  inputs still warms the database's own caches and the operating system's page
  cache, as any UTXO lookup does. (TODO: PR number)
