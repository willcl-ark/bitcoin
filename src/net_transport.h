     *                       message, when there is a non-empty payload that follows.
     *            - No:      the transport itself has no more bytes to send, but will have bytes to
     *                       send if handed a message through SetMessageToSend. In V1Transport this
     *                       happens when sending the payload of a message.
     *            - Blocked: the transport itself has no more bytes to send, and is also incapable
     *                       of sending anything more at all now, if it were handed another
     *                       message to send. This occurs in V2Transport before the handshake is
     *                       complete, as the encryption ciphers are not set up for sending
     *                       messages before that point.
     *
     *            The boolean 'more' is true for Yes, false for Blocked, and have_next_message
     *            controls what is returned for No.
     *
     * @return a BytesToSend object. The to_send member returned acts as a stream which is only
     *         ever appended to. This means that with the exception of MarkBytesSent (which pops
     *         bytes off the front of later to_sends), operations on the transport can only append
     *         to what is being returned. Also note that m_type and to_send refer to data that is
