 * of one transaction (optionally with its unconfirmed parent) over the node's Tor SOCKS5 proxy,
 * exactly as the standalone tool does: raw sockets, its own discovery from the release seeds, no
 * CConnman, PeerManager, addrman or banman involvement. The manager adds only a FIFO of pending
 * transactions, a small pool of workers, retained reports, and one piece of observation for the
 * report: when the node's own mempool first saw the transaction, which never feeds back into a
 * job.
 *
 * Known residual: a job ends when its last announced connection ends, and its worker then takes
 * the next queued job. A recipient that holds or drops a connection can therefore shift when the
 * next queued job starts by up to that connection's lifetime. That is a conditional link between
 * two transactions from one node, not a node identifier, and is accepted for simplicity.
